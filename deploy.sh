# Simple deployment script for Shiny app
#
# IMPORTANT:
# 1. This script uses sshpass and relies on environment variables for credentials.
#    For enhanced security, using SSH key-based authentication is strongly recommended over passwords.
# 2. Ensure 'sshpass' is installed on the machine running this script (e.g., sudo apt-get install sshpass).
# 3. Ensure 'devtools' is installed in the R environment on the server for the user executing the R command.
# 4. The SSH user (defined by DEPLOY_USER or defaulting to 'root') must have permissions for:
#    - git pull in the APP_DIR
#    - Installing R packages (consider user-specific R libraries if not running as root)
#    - Restarting the shiny-server service via supervisorctl (may require sudo)
# 5. Adjust APP_DIR, SHINY_SERVICE_NAME, or the 'sudo supervisorctl restart...' command if your setup differs.
# 6. Using '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' with SSH bypasses host
#    key verification, which is a security risk (potential man-in-the-middle attacks).
#    Remove these options if you have manually accepted the host key or prefer higher security.
